ShoePairClassifier is a convolutional neural network designed to predict whether two shoes are from the same pair or from different pairs.
This project aims to assist individuals who are visually impaired, enhancing their independence by aiding in everyday tasks like sorting and identifying shoes.

Update Paths:
  Modify the file paths in the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) to reflect the paths relevant to your local setup. If you're not using Google Colab, you may need to adjust additional parts of the code to suit your environment.
Function File: 
  Do not modify the function file (function.py). Leave it as is to ensure the project functions correctly.
Running the Model:
  Execute the provided scripts in the Jupyter notebook to train the model and save the model weights to a .pkl file. This file will be used to load the model with its trained parameters for future predictions.
